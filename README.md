# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Project

The dashboard focus on analyzing patient data related to heart disease, with an emphasis on metrics such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, chest pain, and ST depression. 
Here's an overall interpretation of the insights and patterns that can be derived from the data:

1. Patient Metrics & Heart Disease Status
The dashboards provide critical health metrics:

Cholesterol Levels: Averaging between ~239 and ~261 across different groups. High cholesterol levels are a key indicator of heart disease risk.
Heart Rate: Ranges between ~148 and ~151, which might indicate stress or underlying health issues in patients with heart disease.
Blood Pressure (BP): Averages around 130–133, indicating that many patients fall in the hypertensive or pre-hypertensive range.
ST Depression: This data suggests possible ischemia (insufficient blood flow to the heart), which is critical in heart disease diagnosis.
Heart Disease Presence:

Dashboards consistently display a percentage split between patients with "Heart Disease Present" vs. "Absent."
This segmentation enables understanding of the population affected by heart disease and highlights trends for treatment focus.

**2. Correlation Analysis**
Cholesterol vs. Blood Pressure:

Cholesterol levels and BP show trends, likely suggesting a relationship between high cholesterol and elevated blood pressure, both being risk factors for heart disease.
This is crucial for preventive care—targeting patients with borderline cholesterol or BP levels.
ST Depression vs. Age:

ST depression is plotted against age groups, indicating whether ischemic symptoms are more prevalent in certain age demographics. Older patients likely have higher ST depression levels due to chronic heart issues.

**3. Chest Pain Analysis**
Chest Pain Categories:
Patients are categorized by types of chest pain: Asymptomatic, Non-Anginal, Typical Angina, etc.
Trends across age groups (Young, Middle-aged, Elderly) suggest how chest pain symptoms vary by age. For example:
Elderly patients may report more asymptomatic pain or non-anginal symptoms, masking underlying heart conditions.
Young or Middle-aged patients might show more typical angina, a direct symptom of heart disease.

**4. Gender Trends**
Segmentation by gender (male, female) allows for identifying differences in heart disease prevalence and associated metrics like cholesterol or BP. This can inform gender-specific interventions:
Males: Possibly higher prevalence of heart disease and higher cholesterol/BP levels.
Females: Data could highlight underdiagnosed conditions like atypical chest pain.

**Actionable Insights**

High-Risk Groups:

Patients with high cholesterol and BP should be monitored closely for heart disease.
Older adults with significant ST depression require immediate attention.
Preventive Interventions:

Early interventions targeting younger age groups with borderline cholesterol and BP can help prevent progression to heart disease.
Lifestyle changes or medications for those with atypical chest pain symptoms (especially in females or elderly).
Gender-Specific Focus:

Understand differences in symptoms and diagnosis to improve care for both genders.
Strategic Resource Allocation:

Prioritize high-risk demographics for healthcare interventions based on observed metrics and correlations.
